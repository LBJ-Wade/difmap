userio.c:

  user_lprintf() needs to allow both float and double with the 'f' format
                 specifier.

  Split input_array() into input_flt_array() and input_dbl_array()?

  fmt_read() needs to support both float and double arguments with
             the 'f' specifier.

table.c:

  check_func() and check_var() need to accept 'd' when checking type
  declarations.

sphere.h:

  Add Equiv::dval.
  Add DBLPTR() macro.

  Add 'd' to documentation of Functype::type.

sphere.c:

  store_const():

   Add assignment for 'd'.

  mem_size_of():

   Add 'd' clause.

run.h:

  Add 'd' documentation for Exprtype::type.

run.c:

  Need double do loop.
  Need double operators.
  Need conversions between double and both int and float types.
  Need to write double_assign()
  Need 'd' clause in valof_alloc()
  And other simpler changes.

ops.h:

  Add Optype::d_op

ops.c:

  Add Optype::d_op initializers for each operator.

lex.c:

  lex_expr() should store floating point numbers as double constants.

iolib.c:

  Need to write read_double()
  read_array() needs to read double as well as float, depending on
   the needs of the return array.
  write_fn() and read_fn() need to write floats and doubles.
  type_string() needs to return "double" for type 'd'.

func.c:

  Add a "double" declarator.
  Add 'f' clause to type_fn(), print_fn() and strnum_fn().

compile.c:

  do_block(): Add support for double do-loops.
  found_op_err(): Add output for double types.
  stack_operand(): Add support for double operators.
  get_expr(): Add conversions between double and int and float.
  check_expr(): Add conversions between double and int and float.
                Accept 'd' for 'n' declarations.

mathlib.c:

  A lot - Need to make double versions of every function!
