baselines, allchan, start_time, end_time
Unflag a set of baselines over a selectable time range.
EXAMPLES
--------
The following example unflags all visibilities of the currently
selected channels.

 0>unflag *
 Unflagging all baselines in the currently selected channels.

The next example unflags all visibilities of sub-array 2 of
the currently selected channels.

 0>unflag 2:
 Unflagging baselines of subarray 2 in the currently selected channels.

The next example unflags just the visibilities of baselines that are
associated with an antenna called rx3, (in the default subarray,
which is 1). If rx3 were in sub-array 2, you would type 2:rx3.

 0>unflag rx3
 Unflagging baselines of antenna 1:RX3 in the currently selected channels.

The next example unflags just a single baseline, but this time for all
channels, irrespective of the current selection.

 0>unflag rx3-rx5, true
 Unflagging baseline 1:RX3-RX5 in all channels.

The final example unflags all baselines in just the selected channels,
between 10:45 and 10:50 on the 20th of November 2001.

 0>unflag *, false, 20-nov-2001:10:45, 20-nov-2001:10:50
 Unflagging all baselines in the currently selected channels.

PARAMETERS
----------

baselines  -   The set of baselines to unflag, specified by one
               of the following forms:

                 *         -    All baselines in all sub-arrays.

                 sub:      -    All baselines in the sub-array
                                specified by the number 'sub'.

                 sub:ta    -    All baselines of the telescope
                                named 'ta', in sub-array 'sub'.

                 sub:ta-tb -    The single baseline of the
                                telescopes named 'ta' and 'tb'.

               In the above, if sub: is omitted from the last
               two specifications, 1: is quietly substituted.

allchan    -   Default = false
               If true, unflag visibilities of the specified
               baselines over all channels and IFs. Otherwise
               only unflag visibilities in the channels that
               were last selected with the 'select' command.

start_time -   Default = ""
               If not omitted, or specified as an empty string,
               visibility editing will start from the start of
               the observation. Otherwise this argument should
               specify the date and time at which editing
               should start, specified in the following format.

                 dd-mmm-yyyy-mm:hh:mm:ss

               Where dd is the day of the month 1-31, mmm is
               a standard 3-letter abreviation of a month name,
               and yyyy is a fully qualified year (ie. 2003, not
               03). Trailing components of the time that follows
               the date can be omitted. The hour part, hh, is
               an hour number 0-23. The minute part, mm and the
               seconds part, ss go from 0-59.

end_time   -   Default = ""
               If omitted, or specified as an empty string,
               visibilities from the start time to the end of
               the observation will be edited. Otherwise this
               argument should specify the date and time at
               which editing should end, using the same format
               as described for the start_time argument.

CONTEXT
-------
In most cases it is best to edit visibilities visually, using a
visibility inspection command like vplot, tplot or radplot. However
sometimes it is desirable to be able to be able to perform editting
from a script, without any user interaction. The 'unflag' command
facilitates this.
