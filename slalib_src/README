Included in this directory is a sub-set of the C version of the
Starlink slalib library, used for positional astronomy.

All *.c files in this directory are copyright of the author of slalib,
Patrick Wallace, and are included here with his permission. Please
note that the library is provided as-is, with no implication or
assurance of suitability for any purpose.

You can pick up the source code for the whole library (C or FORTRAN),
by anonymous ftp from:

If you would like general information about Starlink software, please
e-mail ussc@star.rl.ac.uk.

Also note that in order to take leap seconds completely into account,
the file, dat.c should be updated every time that a new leap-second is
announced. This may be accomplished by copying the updated version of
this file from the above anonymous FTP site, or it may be edited by hand.
